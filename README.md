Firewall Implementation using Intrustion Detection

This project focuses on building a basic firewall which can prevent the network packets come inside the 
network in an unauthorized manner. This works with the mechanism of Intrusion Detection System by 
making the unauthorized packets to stop in the firewall built and allow only the authorized packets 
to enter the network.

How this Project script works:
1. Network packets comes through the router to the system.
2. When this happens, the firewall built will interfere this packets.
3. While interfering this packets, the firewall detects for authorized packets which are
   pre-programmed to the script to find such packets.
4. After this, the firewall will stop those packets from entering the system or network like an Intrusion Detection System.
